Amazon VPC:
  Max 5 VPCs are allowed per account per Region.
  Decide the CIDR block or IP address range.

Subnets:
  Are a subset of the VPC CIDR block.
  Each subnet resides within one AZ.
  An AZ can contain multiple subnets.
  5 addresses are reserved.
  Route table config will help in connecting to Internet gateway for public subnets.

Internet Gateways:
  Connecting private subnets with outside internet.

Network Access Translation Gateway(NAT):
 Connecting resources in a private subnet to the Internet Gateway.

Elastic network interface:
  Logical networking component in a VPC.

Network Access Control Lists(NACL):
  Acts as a firewall at the subnet boundary.
  Stateless and requires explicit rules for all traffic.

Security Groups:
  A virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic based on defined rules 
  Blocks all inbound traffic, unless we create a rule.
  All outbound traffics are allowed.

Security group chaining:
  Stateful.
  Inbound and outbound rules allow traffic flow from the top tier to bottom tier.
  Acts as a firewalls to prevent a subnet-wide security breach.
