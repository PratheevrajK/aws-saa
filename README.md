Notes and Recommendations:
  - Review the Cloud Practitioner material if you are new to AWS.
  - Use the Technical Essentials course to become familiar with core services (EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, RDS, Lambda).
  - Practice hands-on: create a free-tier AWS account and build small labs for networking, compute, storage, and IAM.
  - Take practice exams and time yourself to build exam pacing.
