    - Application & OS image
    - Instance type & size
    - Key pair
    - Netowrk & Security - VPC, subnet and SG.
    - Storage
    - Placement & Tenancy (Optional)
    - Scripts & Metadata (Optional)
  AMI-Amazon Machine Image:
  Instance families:
    - General purpose
    - Memory optimized
    - Storage optimized
    - Compute optimized
    - Accelerated compute
    - HPC optimized
  Tenancy:
    - Shared

    - Dedicated hosts
  Placements groups:
    We can chose how close or far the instances are from each other.
  User Data:
    Runs scripts as root after the instance launches.
  Instance metadata:
    Information about launched EC2 instance.
  Purchase options:
    - On-Demand
    - Savings plan
    - Spot instances

EBS-Elastic Block Storage:
  Create block-level storage with automatic volume replication in your AZ.
  Attach one or more EBS volumes to a single EC2 instance.
  Move EBS volumes between EC2 instances as needed.
  Volumes types:
    Solid state drive(SSD):
      - high performance
      - general purpose
    Hard disk drive(HDD):
      - Throughput Optimized HDD
      - Cold HDD

Instance store volumes:
  Local to instance
  Non-persistent
  Doesn't support snapshots
  Available in HDD, SDD, and non-volatile memory express SDD(NVMe SSD) varities.

Lambda:
  Servless compute
  Runs for upto 15mins
  Supports upto 10GB memory
